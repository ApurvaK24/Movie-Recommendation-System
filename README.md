# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is my DSBDAL miniproject.<br />
A movie recommendation system is a type of recommendation system designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences, historical interactions, and other relevant factors. These systems are widely used in streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and others, to provide personalized movie recommendations to their users.<br />

There are several approaches to building movie recommendation systems:<br />
1. Content Based Recommendation System<br />
2. Popuratity Based Recommendation System<br />
3. Collaborative Based Recommendation System<br />
